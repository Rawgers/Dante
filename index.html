    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we first attempt to simulate wind using wind field
      models. We then apply this wind field to a fire simulation.
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract:</h2>
    <p>
      Wind is an interesting phenomenon because it affects the behavior of the
      world without being visible. These properties of wind make it challenging
      to be simulated in computer graphics. Nonetheless, convincing, efficient
      simulations of wind are important in creating realistic representations of
      the world. In this project, we adopt the work of Dr. Khorloo Oyundolgor in
      A Study on Efficient Algorithms for Generating Virtual Wind Field Usable
      for Real-time Animation. Using Oyundolgor’s noise-based algorithm, we
      generate wind field maps in real time to demonstrate the computational
      efficiency of simulating wind. We proceed to apply this wind field to a
      fire animation simulation to demonstrate a manifestation of the wind
      field. Along the way, we also explore the similarities between simulating
      wind and fire.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals and Deliverables:</h2>
    <p>
      Our first deliverable will be snapshots of a wind field, a color-coded
      vector field of wind direction and turbulency, generated in real time.
      Our second and final deliverable will be an application of this wind field
      in a fire simulation with customizable parameters that affect the
      appearance and animation of the simulation. Should we have more time, we
      also hope to simulate fire spread, different kinds of fire—such as a
      candle flame—and a simulation of wind on a field of grass using 2D wind
      field over grass generated by Bézier curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to accomplish this we should have a fully functioning and
      parameterized model for simulating wind, and have this wind interact with
      the fire in a natural way. This should all be done efficiently in real
      time. If everything goes well, more work can be done to make the fire more
      realistic, like applying textures to the particles and making the fire
      grow/shrink in response and over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will gauge performance by whether or not the simulation can be rendered
      on a laptop with an Intel 2.5GHz CPU processor and AMD Radeon R9 M370X
      graphics card at 30fps. For accuracy, we will reference the wind field
      output and fire simulation images shown in the Oyundolgor paper and
      compare the results. Lastly, we will try to subjectively evaluate how
      natural and convincing the fire looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      With our analysis we hope to answer the questions of how realistic the
      generated wind and fire look and how efficient they are to compute and
      render. Some other questions we hope to answer are what parameters to use
      for noise generation to best simulate realistic wind, what what parameters
      for wind speed we can use the generate the best and most realistic
      looking effects on the fire.
    </p>
    <h2>Schedule:</h2>
    <p>
      Our schedule will be divided into three main parts: simulating the wind,
      simulating the fire, and preparing materials for the final paper and
      presentation. For the first part the main tasks involve creating the wind
      field, following the 7 step model proposed in the Oyundolgor paper. This
      is predicted to be the most challenging part of the project. The wind
      simulation will first be static with a constant wind field and then made
      dynamic using random noise as outlined in the paper, simulating changing
      wind velocities. Deliverables visualizing the wind field will have to be
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second part involves creating the fire and having the wind act upon
      the fire. For the fire we plan to use Unity’s particles generator which
      allows individual control over their particles. Each of the particles will
      be acted upon by the wind velocities in the wind field. Additional work
      may be done to make the fire more realistic looking, such as through
      applying textures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final part involves creating the writeup and presentation
      deliverables. We will create an interactive demo with a fire blowing in
      the wind for the main presentation. This demo will allow customizing wind
      speeds and directions in real time. We will also do a writeup of the
      techniques presented in the paper along with our own visualizations of the
      wind field and fire.
    </p>
    <h2>Resources:</h2>
    <p>
      Our main resource will be the paper A Study on Efficient Algorithms for
      Generating Virtual Wind Field Usable for Real-Time Animation (2012) by
      Khorloo Oyundolgor. This paper outlines simulating wind and its
      applications to different domains, including grass, cloth, and fire
      simulation. We will use Unity as our rendering engine.
